I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/'>National University of Singapore (NUS)</a>.
I research in the <a href='https://marmotlab.org/'>Multi-Agent Robotic Motion (MARMot) Laboratory</a> advised by Asst. Prof. <a href='https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/sartoretti-guillaume-a/'>Guillaume Sartoretti</a>.
Before this, I obtained my Master of Science degree from NUS and a B.Eng degree in Mechatronics from the <a href='http://en.hit.edu.cn/'>Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)</a>.

My primary research interests lie in the areas of robot learning, coordinated path planning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.
In the long term, I aim to enhance the quality, scalability, and generalizability of decision-making in multi-agent systems, to better prepare for and accelerate our progress toward a future world increasingly populated with intelligent agents.
